OpenQSE is developing an open, modular ecosystem to define specifications
that enable seamless integration between high-performance computing (HPC)
and quantum computing through interoperable, vendor-neutral technologies.
By bringing together leaders from industry, academia, and research, OpenQSE seeks to
establish a community-driven foundation for the next generation of quantumâ€“HPC
software.
