Open Quantum-HPC Software Ecosystem (openQSE) is developing an open,
modular ecosystem to define specifications that enable seamless
integration between high-performance computing (HPC) and quantum computing
through interoperable, vendor-neutral technologies.  By bringing together
leaders from industry, academia, and research, openQSE seeks to establish
a community-driven foundation for the next generation of quantum–HPC
software.
