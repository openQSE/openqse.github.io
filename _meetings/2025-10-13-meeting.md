## Notes

* **Terminology:**

  * Travis suggested adopting the term **Quantum Computing Resource (QCR)** instead of *Quantum Resource*.
  * A **QCR** is defined as a collection of subsystems, including the **QPU**, **classical compute**, **wave generators**, and **control systems**—essentially, all components required for QPU operation.

* **Role of Classical Compute within the QCR:**

  * Encompasses all classical processes necessary for quantum system operation (e.g., **decoding**, **error correction**, **calibration**).
  * It is still unclear whether higher-level applications like **VQE** should be considered part of the QCR.
  * Classical compute within the QCR should ideally be **dedicated** to the quantum device; otherwise, resource management becomes more complex.

* **Low Latency vs. Real-Time:**

  * **Real-time** operations have strict timing requirements—failure to meet them results in operational failure.
  * **Low-latency** operations improve performance but are not timing-critical for correctness.

* **Location of Transpilation and Compilation:**

  * Discussion on whether **transpiling** and **compiling** should occur **within the QCR** or on **separate HPC resources**.

## Action Items

* Create a **PR** to define the concept of a **Quantum Computing Resource (QCR)**.
* Develop **sequence diagrams** to clarify the **interfaces and interactions** within and around the QCR.
