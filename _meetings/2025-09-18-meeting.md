## Agenda
- Settle on the meeting times
   - Votes so far are: A=9, B=5, C=7.
   - Looks like we will alternate between A (Monday?) and C (Thursday?)
- Propose a paper which covers the terms we're discussing be our next milestone. Similar to: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X25002699
- Continue discussing the terms: Hybrid, Tight coupling and Loose Coupling as highlighted in this issue: https://github.com/openQSE/openqse-spec/issues/5

## Notes
- Discussion about meeting times -- show of hands, general agreement on Monday meetings, alternating times
    - Discussion about Glossary project
        - @mocha Shared a [link to a paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X25002699)
        - General consensus that there's a lot of complexity here and that need to ensure scope stays focused on quantum worfklows and architectures, have a clearly defined audience
    - Detailed technical discussion about the term 'hybrid'
    - Next meeting will be held on on 2025-09-29

- Additional comments/remarks
    - A couple of notes which are useful to keep track of for future discussions:
    - In the diagram in https://github.com/openQSE/openqse-spec/issues/5 there could be multiple entry points at different layers. Some vendors might provide deeper access into the Quantum Resource than others
this represents a challenge when defining a common interface to different modalities.
    - At some point it would be good to map where the different layers of the software stack run.
