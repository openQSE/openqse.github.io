## Notes
- Travis Humble gave an overview of the objectives and goals of the openQSE initiative
- Travis put a general goal of having v1.0 of the specification in 24 months
- Prioritize on-premises deployments
- Utilize the work that has been done in the field so far, including work that has been done by IBM, LRZ, IonQ, Quantinuum, etc
- Important to set shorter term objectives along the way
- Focus on having code and feature deliverables, beside presentations and papers
- It was suggested that we start off by looking at the Quantum Platform interface API
   - This follows a general architectural consensus

## Todos
- Go over the sequence diagrams in the next meeting
- Fine tune the governance and processes
